                "Salaam, We booked our Hajj with Al Hijaz. The whole experience, from the booking process to the logistics and packages, was smooth and efficient. The organisation of transport was done really well. We were guided all the way, and brother Zahid kept in touch with us to keep us updated on any changes to timings, etc. I highly recommend Al Hijaz for all Umrah and Hajj packages as they really go above and beyond. May Allah SWT bless all at Al Hijaz with Barakah. Ameen. JazakAllah Khair again",
